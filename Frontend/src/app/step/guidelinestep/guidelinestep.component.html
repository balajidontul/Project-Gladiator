<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-primary">The functionaries of the implementing agencies and the link agencies and the voluntary
        organisations involved would initially be given a suitable orientation towards the scope, objectives
        and requirements under the projects for the effective implementation of the project. Sensitization
        towards women’s issue will be an integral part of training at all levels including the project
        implementing agencies and the beneficiaries as well.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-secondary"> Women will be given training on various aspects, including group formation, skill
        upgradation management of the primary producer groups and co-operatives, entrepreneurship skills,
        marketing, awareness of their rights and gender concern etc. So as to equip them to face, overcome
        and resolve their economic and social constraints and problems at their own level and to promote
        genuine empowerment. This is the basic approach towards the evaluation of the Status of women.
</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-success">The implementing agency in the project formulation will outline the training arrangements of
        the beneficiaries, extension workers, field supervisors and technical staff, etc. identifying the training
        institute, guidelines of training, cost estimate etc. No additional training institute will be established.
        The existing infrastructure already available will be uplifted and Training will be through accredited
        agencies/Trainers. NIPCCD will coordinate the training arrangements and ensure that the training is
        imparted not only in the technical trade to upgrade the skills of market management, but also in
        gender sensitization, gender awareness, including legal literacy and sensitization.
</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger"> Strong forward and backward linkages will be essential to ensure the viability and success of
        the economic activities of the project in the sector. The implementing agency will help for the
        provision of raw materials, ensure proper marketing and tie-ups for marketing of the produce’s during
        the project period and help the groups of women under the project to manage these activities within
        the group once the project is over. The implementing agency will help up in tying up credit facilities.
        Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK) will be included as a nodal agency for micro credit facilities. Besides,
        other financial institutions/agencies may be considered for credit linkages of the beneficiaries
        depending on their presence in the area. The women’s groups should not be wholly captive to
        Governmental Corporations for marketing their products in the interest of making the groups selfsustaining in
        their rural set up. One of the project objectives will be to ensure that these groups are
        able to develop and thrive on a self-sustaining basis in the market place, with the minimal of
        Governmental and formal support and intervention.
</li>
    <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-warning">The implementing agency will issue Photo Identity Card to all beneficiaries for the project and a copy
        of the same will be forwarded to the Ministry for records.
</li>
